# Extended_LinkMap

This is a helper repo for multiple projects, featuring (cuda) wrappers, functions and classes for easier CUDA event/stream management. 
It is not designed for standalone use (yet). 

UNDER DEVELOPMENT: This repo is currently being updated with automated transfer routing and cost-aware queues.
